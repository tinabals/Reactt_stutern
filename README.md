1. List five significant features of React:

a. JSX syntax for creating UI components
b. Virtual DOM for efficient rendering and updating of the UI
c. Component-based architecture for building complex UIs
d. One-way data binding for easy debugging and state management
e. React Native for building cross-platform mobile applications

2. List five major advantages of React:

a. Improved performance due to virtual DOM and efficient rendering
b. Large community support and availability of open-source libraries and tools
c. Component-based architecture for easy maintenance and scalability
d. Ability to build cross-platform applications with React Native
e. SEO friendly due to server-side rendering with libraries like Next.js

3. What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?
React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. React is an open-source project owned and maintained by Facebook.

4. What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them.

JSX uses a syntax extension of JavaScript, while HTML is a markup language.
In JSX, elements can be written using self-closing tags, while in HTML, all tags must have a closing tag.
In JSX, attributes are written using camelCase, while in HTML, attributes are written using kebab-case.

5. Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?

Browsers can only read HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but JSX is not a standard web language. It is a syntax extension of JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. In order for browsers to read JSX, it needs to be converted to JavaScript using a transpiler like Babel. This conversion process is usually handled by build tools like webpack or create-react-app, which generate JavaScript code that can be read by browsers.
